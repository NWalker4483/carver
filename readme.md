# Watch stl

Display an stl in a native window. Refresh whenever the file is modified.

## Installation

* https://github.com/TristanAntonsen/marching-cubes/
* https://github.com/bddap/watch-stl-rust.git

You'll need the [rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html) for that last step.

## Use

```
watch-stl path/to/model.stl
```

Now you can use your mouse to rotate and zoom the model.
